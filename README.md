# Fake-News-Detector

we have 2 datasets one for true and one for fake identification .

# Aim:

User will input any entry from fake dataset or from true dataset and the model should predict is it a Fake news or a true one.

Basic Idea:

we can assign a differnt class for true and false dataset. I have assigned 0 for fake news and 1 for not a fake news.

Now I have taken 1000 rows from each of the dataset and merged them and form a different dataset . We used this dataset for train and test purpose of our model and perfom rest of the operations.

### Random Forest is used for training and tuning our model and return the accuracy Score.
